**<h1>Tic Tac Toe -  Bedros Asdorian Â© </h1>**
This application allows users to play a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe. I created this project as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program and I hope you will get some enjoyment out of it!

<h2>Planning</h2>
Firstly, I started out with designing the lay-out of the web page so i could have an idea of how I want the structure and skeleton of the web page to look like. Second, i started out with the HTML. As Tic Tac Toe is played in a 3x3 grid, i created 9 divs to house the Xs and OS. Moving on to the CSS, I used Flexbox so the 3x3 tiles could have a responsive layout, and be played with ease on different devices with different viewports. I also implemented some extra animations like hover, over the reset button so the project could have that aesthetic feel. Moving on to the core of the Project, the JS file. I declared some initial variables like my gameboard cells (an array with 9 indeces of all empty strings), also that the current player is X and the winnig conditions ( Player X won / Player O won / Tie ).
